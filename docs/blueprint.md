- Employ a modern, legible sans-serif font like 'Inter' for UI elements, ensuring clear readability on mobile devices.
- Utilize clear, outline-style icons to represent common actions, categories, and wallet functionalities.
- Design a single-screen, non-scrolling home screen with a centered ET coin and a bottom navigation bar for key sections.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as particle bursts on tap and confetti on successful purchases, to enhance user engagement.
